    "text": "Downloading and install R and RStudio on to your laptop\nRStudio is an open source software, and today its the go-to software for many researchers - its highly recommended for anyone in the domains of data science, scientific research, and technical communication.\nIt is easy to access, and easy to download and install. In order for RStudio to work you must first install R. You can follow the steps to download and install the correct version of R and RStudio for your operating system (i.e., Windows or MAC).\n\nInstallation for MacOS users\nYou will need to have the following software installed for R and RStudio to work properly on MAC.\n\nR (version 4.5.1) and RStudio (version 2025.09.0-387)\nXQuartz (version 2.8.5)\nXCode (version 26.0.1)\nGNU Fortran (version 12.2)\n\nInstallation of R (4.5.1) and RStudio (2025.09.0-387) on MAC:\n\n\n\nOS User type\nR (Base)\nRStudio Desktop\n\n\n\n\nMAC (Intel)\nR-4.5.1-x86_64.pkg\nRStudio-2025.09.0-387.dmg\n\n\nMAC (M1, M2, M3, or M4)\nR-4.5.1-arm64.pkg\nRStudio-2025.09.0-387.dmg\n\n\n\n\nFirst download the appropriate R (Base) file for the appropriate MacOS.\nDouble-click the downloaded file (i.e., R-4.5.1-x86_64.pkg or R-4.5.1-arm64.pkg) and follow the steps to complete the installation.\nNext, download the RStudio-2025.09.0-387.dmg to install RStudio.\nDouble-click the downloaded file (i.e., RStudio-2023.06.2-561.dmg) and then drag and drop the RStudio icon into the Applications folder to complete the installation.\n\nInstallation of XQuartz (2.8.5):\nSome functions in R require some of the libraries from XQuartz to function properly on your MAC.\n\nYou can download the latest version of XQuartz (XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg) by clicking on this LINK and complete the installation process by following its steps.\n\nInstallation of XCode (26.0.1):\nSome functions in R require some of the external developer tools from XCode application to function properly on your MAC.\n\nGo to the App Store application and get the XCode app downloaded by clicking on this LINK.\nOnce it is downloaded, you can click on the “OPEN” button to verify it’s been downloaded. A window will prompt you to complete installation.\n\nGNU Fortran (version 12.2):\nR (Base) and some packages require the GNU Fortran 12.2 compiler in order to function smoothly on your MacOS.\n\nDownload this specific version of GNU Fortran 12.2 (gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg) by clicking on this LINK and simply complete the installation process by following the steps on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above four steps should complete the installation process for R and RStudio on MAC.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation for Windows users\nYou will need to have the following software installed for the rstan package to work on Windows.\n\nR (version 4.5.1)\nRtools45 (version 4.5)\nRStudio (version 2025.09.0-387)\n\nInstallation of R (4.5.1) and RStudio RStudio (2025.09.0-387) on Windows:\n\n\n\nOS User type\nR (Base)\nRStudio Desktop\n\n\n\n\nWindows\nR-4.5.1-win.exe\nRStudio-2025.09.0-387.exe\n\n\n\n\nDownload the file for R-4.5.1-win.exe attached in the table above.\nDouble-click the downloaded file (i.e., R-4.5.1-win.exe) and follow the steps to complete the installation.\nNow, we can download the file (i.e., RStudio-2025.09.0-387.exe) for RStudio from the link provided in the above table.\nDouble-click the downloaded file (i.e., RStudio-2025.09.0-387.exe) and follow the steps from the installer to complete the installation.\n\nInstallation of Rtools 4.5\nFor Windows users, after you have completed the installation for R and RStudio, you are required to install the Rtools45 package as it contains some libraries and developer tools for the smooth functioning of R.\n\nDownload the latest version of Rtools45 by clicking on this LINK to initiate the download of the Rtools45 installer.\nDouble-click the downloaded rtools45-6608-6492.exe file and follow the steps to complete the installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above two steps should complete the installation process for R and RStudio on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe installation of all programs on Windows and MacOS are specifically for R (version 4.5.1) and RStudio (version 2025.09.0-387), which are the most up-to-date versions of R and RStudio, respectively, as of writing these instructions today (02/10/2025). If an update get pushed for these software - make sure to check that supporting programs (i.e., Rtools for Windows, and XQuartz & XCode for Mac) are updated.\n\n\nThis concludes the installation section and sets your computer up for the course.",

    "text": "Welcome to GEOG0114: Principles of Spatial Analysis, one of the core 1st term modules for this MSc programme (Social and Geographic Data Science). This module has been designed as an introduction to the core tenets and principles of spatial analysis. Here, you will learn the key concepts and spatial analytical methods, which are applicable to the domains of social science and geography.\nIn the first three weeks, we will cover Spatial analysis for data science, Graphical representation of spatial data and Spatial autocorrelation.\nAfterwards, in week 4, 5 and 6, we will cover a variety of basic geostatistical techniques that require analysis of point and raster data - these include suitability mapping such as Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ecological Niche Modelling; and then Geostatistical analysis using Kriging.\nIn week 7, 8, and 9, we will learn specialised tools for performing spatial analysis on vector data (e.g., point, line and areal structures) - these include the various spatial regression model families e.g., Spatial Lag & Error models, Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) and Spatial Risk Models. All these tutorials will be covered in RStudio.\n\n\nAll lectures and computer practicals will be delivered in-person. All Lectures are held on Monday from 01:00pm to 02:00pm at the North West Wing (Room G17). All computer lab seminars are delivered on Thursday from 03:00pm to 05:00pm at the North West Wing (Room G07).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease bring your laptops with you to the computer practicals on Thursday\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodle is the central point of your learning experience for GEOG0114.
