    "text": "3 Loading our data sets for case study\nFor this analysis we have three different data sets available: schools in London, greenspace in London (split into two separate data sets), and wards (an administrative geography) in London. All three of our data sets are provided as shapefiles which will make working with the data relatively straight-forward (e.g. even for our point data, the schools, we do not need to convert them from a csv as we often find with this type of data). But we’ll need to do quite a few steps of processing to get our final data set.\nLet’s go ahead and load our three variables - we will use the sf library st_read() command to load our data sets into variables for use within our code:\n\n# load london schools shapefile\nlondon_schools &lt;- st_read('school_data_london_2016.shp')\n\n# load london wards shapefile\nlondon_wards &lt;- st_read('london_wards.shp')\n\n# load the two london greenspace shapefiles\nTL_greenspace &lt;- st_read('TL_GreenspaceSite.shp')\nTQ_greenspace &lt;- st_read('TQ_GreenspaceSite.shp')\n\nTo see what each variable looks like, you can type in plot(name_of_variable) into the R console.

    "section": "4 Data Processing",
    "text": "4 Data Processing\nNow we have our data loaded as variables, we’re ready to start processing! In spatial data processing, the question always is: where do I start first? And the easiest answer to that is: make sure all of your data is in the same Projected (or Coordinate) Reference System as each other. Checking - and changing projections - should always be the first step of any workflow as this will ensure you do not carry through any potential mistakes or errors that using the wrong system can cause.\n\n4.1 Reprojecting\nWhen you loaded your data sets in the above step, you may have notice that in the console additional information about the data set is printed - this includes the metadata on the data set’s Coordinate Reference System! As a result, it is quite easy to simply scroll the terminal to check the CRS for each data set - which as you’ll see, all the data sets bar the school are using EPSG 27700, which is the code for British National Grid, whereas our schools data set shows 3857, the code for Web Mercator. That means we need to start with our london_schools variable - as we know that this is the only data set currently in the wrong projection instead of using British National Grid.\nTo reproject our data set, we can use a function within the sf library, known as st_transform(). It is very simple to use - you only need to provide the function with the data set and the code for the new CRS you wish to use with the data. For now, we will simply store the result of this transformation as a new variable - but you could in the future, rewrite this code to use pipes to pipe this transformation when loading the data set.\n\n# reproject london schools from Web Mercator to BNG \nlondon_schools_prj &lt;- st_transform(london_schools, 27700)\n\nWe can now double-check our new variable is in the correct CRS by typing the following into the console and checking the result:\n\n# check CRS \nst_crs(london_schools_prj)\n\nAs you can see from the output above, our data set has been reprojected into EPSG 27700 or British National Grid!\nThe next step to process our london_schools_prj data set is to reduce the schools to only our chosen London extent. As you may have seen from the map above, our schools cover an area larger than our usual London extent. We can even make a quick map of this to check this properly:\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_wards) + \n  tm_polygons() + \ntm_shape(london_schools_prj) + \n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, we indeed have schools outside of our London wards - as a result, we want to remove those schools outside of this boundary. We will do this by first dissolving our ward file to create a more simplified shapefile for use as a “cookie-cutter”.\n\n\n4.2 Dissolving\nTo dissolve a polygon shapefile using R code, we will use the summarise() function that comes from the dplyr library (part of the tidyverse) and summarise our London wards data set by summing its total area (supplied in the HECTARES attribute field/column) across all records. This will reduce our data frame to a single row, which will only contain one attribute - our total area of London, which we can then map/use as our clip (cookie-cutter) feature!\n\n# dissolve\nlondon_outline &lt;- london_wards %&gt;% summarise(area = sum(HECTARES))\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_outline) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Subsetting\nNow we have our London outline, we can go ahead and clip our schools data set by our London outline. Whilst there is a clip function within the sf library, what we will do here is use a techinque known as spatial subsetting, which is more similar to selecting by location: we will subset our london schools data set by filtering out those that are not within the London Outline. This approach in R is much quicker than using the clip function - although deciding which approach to use is not only a question of speed but also how each function will affect the filtered data. When using a clip function, the function acts exactly like a cookie-cutter and will trim off any data that overlaps with the boundaries used. Conversely, when using a subsetting approach, if a data point or polygon overlaps on the boundary, it will still be included (depending on the topological relationship used) but in its entirety (i.e. no trimming!).\nAs we’re using point data, it is generally easier to use a subset approach. There are multiple ways and notations to conduct spatial subsetting within R:\nFirst, we can either use the [] notation just like you would use for selecting and slicing a normal (table-based) dataframe from R’s base package. Second, sf has its own named functions for geometric operations, including: intersection, difference, symmetrical difference and snap. What actually happens is that when you use the [] notation on the background one of those sf named functions get called. More details on manipulating simple features can be found in this vignette.\nTo keep things simple, we will use the base subsetting approach - which also works similarly when programming in Python, for instance.\n\n# subset London schools\nlondon_schools_prj_ss &lt;- london_schools_prj[london_outline,]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a case like above, you can just overwrite the current london_schools_prj variable as you know it is the data set you want to use. Much of this code could be condensed into several lines using pipes to make our code shorter and more efficient - but then it would be harder to explain! As you progress with R and programming, you are welcome to bring pipes and restructuring into own your code - but even if you don’t, as long as your code does what you need it to do, then that’s our main aim with this course!\n\n\nOnce you have run the above code, you should notice that your london_schools_prj_ss variable now only contains 3,372 records, instead of the original 3,889. We can also plot our variable using the same code as above, to double-check that it worked:\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_wards) + \n  tm_polygons() + \ntm_shape(london_schools_prj_ss) + \n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should now see that our schools are all contained within our ward data set, so we know this data set is ready to be used for analysis. We will now explore which schools are within 400m of greenspace and which are not. But first, we need to get our greenspace data ready so we can create the 400m buffers needed for this analysis.\n\n\n4.4 Unioning\nWe’ve done a lot of processing so far to do with our schools and ward data, but now it’s time for the greenspace data sets. If you look back at your code, you should remember that we have two data sets for our greenspace in London, which we now need to join together. This type of join is typically known as a union - and this is the type of tool you would want to look for across any GUI system.\nWhen it comes to programming, however, in either R or python, there is a much simpler way of joining data sets - and that’s simply copying over the records or observations from one variable into another - and the base library has a ready-to-go function for us to use, known as rbind(). This function allows you to ‘bind’ rows from one or more data sets together. This also works for sf objects.\n\n# join greenspace data sets together\ngreenspace = rbind(TQ_greenspace, TL_greenspace)\n\n\n\n4.5 Clipping\nThe next step is to clip our reduced greenspace data to our London outline. Within sf, the clip function is known as the st_intersection() function - not to be confused with st_intersects() from above! A clip will change the geometry of some of our greenspaces on the outskirts of London, i.e. cookie-cut them precisely to the London outline. If we used the subset approach approach as we did earlier with our point data, we would simply extract all greenspaces that intersect with the London outline - but not change their geometry.\nWhat we can do however if reduce the processing required by our computer by using a mixture of these two methods - if we first subset our all_greenspace data set by our London outline and then run the clip, our processing will be much faster:\n\n# subset and clip\nlondon_greenspace &lt;- greenspace[london_outline,] %&gt;% st_intersection(london_outline)\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_outline) + \n  tm_polygons() + \ntm_shape(london_greenspace) + \n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Attribute selection\nNow we have only London greenspaces in our data set, the next step, is to reduce the number of greenspaces to only those bigger than 50,000 square meters. To do this, we will use another type of subsetting you’ve probably come across, which is attribute subsetting - by using a simple query to subset only records that have an area larger than 50,000 square metres. To do this, we’ll use the filter() function from the dplyr library we mentioned earlier as well as another function called set_units() which is from the unit library that you’ve loaded - but we haven’t yet discussed. The set_units() function allows us to assign units to numerical values we are using within our query, i.e. here, for our query to run, our value must be in square metres to match the unit of the area_m column.\nTo be able to query on our area, we must first calculate the area of each of our greenspaces. To do so in R, we can use the st_area() function within sf, which will calculate the area of each of our records/observations in our greenspace data set. To store the output of this function as a new column in our london_greenspace data set, we use a simple notation at the end of our london_greenspace variable: $area_m. The $ in R means for this data frame, access the column that proceeds this sign. In our case, we do not as yet have a column called area_m, therefore R will automatically create this column and then store the outputs of the function in this column:\n\n# calculate area\nlondon_greenspace$area_m &lt;- st_area(london_greenspace)\n\nOnce we have our area column, we can now filter our data set based on that column and filter out all greenspace with an area that is smaller than 50,000 square meters.\n\n# filter large greenspaces\nlarge_london_greenspace &lt;- london_greenspace %&gt;% filter(area_m &gt; set_units(50000.0, m^2))\n\nWe now can look at our final greenspace data set against our london outline to see its final coverage:\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_outline) + \n  tm_polygons() + \ntm_shape(large_london_greenspace) + \n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Buffering\nWe now have our London greenspace data set - we are ready for the last step of processing with this data set - generating our buffers that we can use to find all schools within 400 meters of the large greenspace areas. Once again, the sf library has a function for generating buffers - we just need to know how to deploy it successfully on our London greenspace data set - and this involves understanding how to denote our distance correctly - as well as understanding if and how we can dissolve our buffer into a single record.\nTo do this, we would investigate the documentation of the function st_buffer() to find out what additional parameters it takes - and how. What we can find out is that we need to (of course!) provide a distance for our buffer - but whatever figure we supply, this will be interpreted within the units of the CRS we are using. In our case, we are using British National Grid and, luckily for us, the units of the CRS is metres - which makes are life significantly easier when calculating these buffers. For other CRS, many use a base unit of an Arc Degree, e.g. WGS84. In this case, you technically have two options: 1) reproject your data into a CRS that uses metres as its base unit OR 2) convert your distance into an Arc Degree measurement. Always choose Option 1.\nFortunately none of this is our concern - we know we can simply input the figure of 400 into our buffer and this will generate a buffer of 400m.\n\n# greenspace buffer\ngs_buffer_400m &lt;- st_buffer(large_london_greenspace, dist=400)\n\nAs our final bit of processing with our greenspace buffer, we want to dissolve the whole buffer into a single record. To do this, we’ll replicate the code used for our London ward dissolve, creating a an area value for our buffer records in the process to be used within the summarisation - and then result in a new gs_buffer_400m_single variable:\n\n# dissolve greenspace buffer\ngs_buffer_400m_single &lt;- gs_buffer_400m %&gt;% summarise(area = sum(st_area(gs_buffer_400m)))\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_outline) + \n  tm_polygons() + \ntm_shape(gs_buffer_400m_single) + \n  tm_polygons()",

    "text": "5 Greenspace in London\nGreat, we are now ready to bring our two data sets together ready for analysis - and to do so, we’ll use subsetting as well as the st_intersects() function, although with this one, we’ll use it in two different ways!\nOur first task is to identify those schools that have access to greenspace - and extract them to create a new variable for use within our final point-in-polygon count (i.e. how many schools within each ward has access to greenspace). As we know, we can subset our london_schools data set by our greenspace buffer quite easily using the subset approach:\n\n# schools within 400m of greenspace\nlondon_schools_gs &lt;- london_schools_prj_ss[gs_buffer_400m_single,]\n\nOur london_schools_gs variable has been subsetted correctly if we end up with 1,770 records, instead of the 3,372 records we had previously. We can now use this data set and our previous london_schools_prj_ss data set to create counts at the ward level. But before we do that, we will create a binary attribute of greenspace access within our london_schools_prj_ss variable to visualise our school ‘points’. To do this, we’ll use the st_intersects() function mentioned above and add a new column, gs_access (i.e. greenspace access), which will tell us which schools have access to greenspace or not.\nThe st_intersects() function is really useful as its output is a simple TRUE or FALSE statement - does this record intersect with the greenspace buffer? This result is what will be stored in our new column as a TRUE or FALSE response and what we can use to map our schools and their greenspace access:\n\n# greenspace access\nlondon_schools_prj_ss$gs_access &lt;- st_intersects(london_schools_prj_ss, gs_buffer_400m_single, sparse=FALSE)\n\nWe could go ahead and recode this to create a 1 or 0, or YES or NO after processing, but for now we’ll leave it as TRUE (green) or FALSE (red). We can go head and now visualise our schools based on this column, to see if they have access (TRUE) or do not have access (FALSE) to greenspace. To do this, we’ll use the tmap library again:\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_schools_prj_ss) + \n    tm_dots(fill = \"gs_access\", \n        fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(values = c(\"red\", \"darkgreen\")), \n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Greenspace Access\", frame = FALSE)\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll be pleased to read that we are finally here - we are at the last stage of our processing and can finally create the ward-level percentage of schools that have greenspace access, versus those that do not! To do this, we’ll be counting the number of points in each of our polygons, i.e. the number of schools in each ward.\nTo do so in R and with sf, it is one line of code - which at first look does not sound at all like it is completing a point-in-polygon calculation - but it does! To create a PIP count within sf, we use the st_intersects() function again - but instead of using the output of TRUE or FALSE, what we actually extract from our function is its lengths recording. The lengths part of this function records how many times a join feature (i.e. our schools) intersects with our main features (i.e. our wards). (Note here, we do not set the sparse function to FALSE but leave it as TRUE/its default by not entering the parameter). As a result, the length of this list is equal to the count of how many schools are within the polygon - i.e. a PIP calculation.\nThis is a really simple way of doing a PIP calculation - and makes it easy for us to store the output of the function and its lengths (and thus the count) directly as a column within our london_wards data set, as so:\n\n# total number of schools in each ward \nlondon_wards$total_schools &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(london_wards, london_schools_prj_ss))\n\n# total number of schools with greenspace access in each ward\nlondon_wards$gs_schools &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(london_wards, london_schools_gs))\n\nAs you can see from the code above, we’ve now calculated this for our total schools data set and the schools that have access to greenspace. The final step in our processing therefore is to create our rate. To do so, we’ll use the same approach of generating a new column within our london_wards data set - and then use a mathematical formula to calculate our rates:\n\n# percentage of schools with greenspace access\nlondon_wards$gs_rate &lt;- (london_wards$gs_schools/london_wards$total_schools)*100\n\nAnd that’s it! We now have our greenspace rate for our wards, which we can now again map:\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(london_wards) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"gs_rate\",\n        fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(n = 5, style = \"pretty\", values = \"brewer.greens\"),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Greenspace Access [%]\", frame = FALSE)\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have our final data set ready for analysis. Right now, we haven’t introduced you to any statistical or spatial analysis techniques to fully analyse our data set - but instead, we can focus on what are data shows visually!\nThe last step of any programming is to extract our variables into permanent data sets for use at a later time. You can at any point in this practical, extract a permanent data file for each of our variables. For now, we’ll extract our new london_wards data set as we might want to use this in some additional analysis that we could look at next week or for our assessments at a later stage. The great thing about coding this up now, is that it will be easy to re-run all of this analysis and export any of the variables, again, at a later time!\n\n# write\nst_write(obj=london_wards, dsn='london_ward_gs.shp', delete_dsn=TRUE)\n\nYou should now see the data set appear in your files!",

    "text": "9 Exercise\nGeoprocessing of spatial-referenced natural hazards: Earthquakes\nThere are severe economic and social consequence of natural hazards such as earthquakes which result innumerable disasters that are instant (e.g., deaths, injury, homes destroyed, transport and communication links disrupted, water pipes burst and water supplies contaminated and many more) and long-term (e.g., disease may spread, re-housing, and most often refugee camps). You can download freely available open-source data on earthquake occurrence worldwide here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/\nTürkiye (or Turkey) is a nation that often experience earthquakes on a frequent basis with nearly over 20 earth tremors in 2022 according to the Turkish Disaster & Emergency Management Authority.\nYou can download the dataset for this homework exercise: [CLICK HERE]\nYou are given the following spatial datasets:\n\nAll_earthquake_points_in_Turkey.shp: 984-point locations of where earthquakes/tremors occurred in Greece and Türkiye in 2019 to 2023 as a shapefile;\ngadm41_TUR_1.shp: The administrative areas of Türkiye as a shapefile; and\nKonya_buildings_at_risk.shp: 25,000+ building footprints from small administrative area in Türkiye called Konya, as a shapefile.\nEarthquake_point_in_Konya.shp: Single point location of an earthquake that is a focal point in Konya.\n\nYour goal for this homework practical is to use the appropriate geoprocessing task to achieve the following tasks:\nTask 1: Use the dataset All_earthquake_points_in_Turkey.shp and gadm41_TUR_1.shp to visualise the distribution of ALL point locations of where earthquakes had occurred ONLY in Türkiye?\nHints: You may want to consider using the following operations: using the st_area() before dissolving to create an outline, and then sub-setting.\nTask 2: How would you go about calculating the overall numbers of reporte earthquakes for each administrative area in Türkiye? Visualise this output as a map.\nHints: You may want to consider creating a new variable total_earthquakes using the st_interects() and lengths() functions.\nTask 3: Use the dataset Konya_buildings_at_risk.shp and Earthquake_point_in_Konya.shp to create a map showing three ringed buffer zones around the focal point of the earthquake. Within each buffer region estimate the number of buildings that are:\n\nAt risk of being destroyed if within distance 0-2000m (1st buffer zone);\nThose that are at risk of being severely damaged if within a distance of 2000-5000m (2nd buffer zone);\nThose that are at risk of receiving partial damages if within a distance of 5000-9000m (last buffer zone);\n\nHints: You may want to consider using the st_buffer(), st_centroids(), st_interects() and st_difference() functions for capturing the buildings within the 0-2000m (1st ring), 2000-5000m (2nd ring), and 5000-9000m (3rd ring) zones.

Let us clip/subset them to create an outline of the region. To do this, we will need to first calculate the areas before dissolving it into one big outline:\n\nturkey_adm_areas$area_est &lt;- st_area(turkey_adm_areas)\n\nNow, dissolve the areas to form the outline:\n\nturkey_outline &lt;- turkey_adm_areas %&gt;% summarise(area = sum(area_est))\n\nNow, subset or cookie-cut the earthquake points that are only within Turkey:\n\nturkey_earthquakes &lt;- all_earthquakes[turkey_outline,]\n\nNow, visualise output:\n\ntm_shape(turkey_outline) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0) +\ntm_shape(turkey_earthquakes) + \n    tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK TWO Using the derived dataset i.e., turkey_earthquakes, we are aggregating the points in those administrative areas i.e., `turkey_adm_areas:\n\nturkey_adm_areas$total_earthquakes &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(turkey_adm_areas, turkey_earthquakes))\n\nIf you check the data frame, you can see a new column has been created with the total counts of earthquakes per region. You can see that the area K.

This is not a good system for distance as its unintuitive especially if you need to calculate one for creating a buffer zone! It is always best to use one that is in metres, kilometres or miles etc.\n\nLet us use the World Mecartor 3857 CRS as its in metres. So let’s change the CRS from 4326 to 3857 for the shapefiles to be in metres. This makes specifying the distance a lot easier:\n\nkonya_buildings_3857 &lt;- st_transform(konya_buildings, 3857)\nfocal_earthquake_point_3857 &lt;- st_transform(focal_earthquake_point, 3857)\n\nNow, let’s create the three buffer zones around the focal earthquake point:\n\n# create buffer for 2000m\ndestroyed_buffer_2000m &lt;- st_buffer(focal_earthquake_point_3857, dist = 2000)\n# second and third buffers are created for 0-5000 and 0-9000\nsec_buffer_5000m &lt;- st_buffer(focal_earthquake_point_3857, dist = 5000)\nthr_buffer_9000m &lt;- st_buffer(focal_earthquake_point_3857, dist = 9000)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of building that exist within 2000m, within 2000-5000m and from 5000-9000m. However, the trickier ones are the zones for 2000-5000m and 5000-9000m as they are rings. Therefore, we need to create ‘ringed’ zones from the buffers through taking the differences between the different buffer zones.\nSo, we can use st_difference() function to create the rings for buffer zones 2000-5000 and 5000-9000 through differencing:\n\n# take the second buffer zone 5000m and substract the inner 2000m buffer from it to retain 2000-5000m\nsevere_damaged_buffer_2000_5000m &lt;- st_difference(sec_buffer_5000m, destroyed_buffer_2000m)\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n# take the third buffer zone 9000m and substract the inner 5000m buffer from it to retain 5000-9000m\npartial_damaged_buffer_5000_9000m &lt;- st_difference(thr_buffer_9000m, sec_buffer_5000m)\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo not worry about the warning message - that is just R/RStudio behaving badly!\n\n\nNow, visual the current output:\n\n# add buildings\ntm_shape(konya_buildings_3857) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0) +\n# add the single focal point of the earthquake\ntm_shape(focal_earthquake_point_3857) + \n    tm_dots(size = 0.5, fill = \"red\", col = \"red\") +\n# add the thirdmost outer ring (5000-9000m) and make fill colour pink, and line as dashes in pink colour\ntm_shape(partial_damaged_buffer_5000_9000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"pink\", fill_alpha = 0.1, col = \"pink\", lwd = 1.1, lty=\"dashed\") +\n# add the second middle ring (2000-5000m)\ntm_shape(severe_damaged_buffer_2000_5000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.2, col = \"red\", lwd = 1.1, lty=\"dashed\") +\n# add the 1st ring as solid red polygon with transparency of 0.4\ntm_shape(destroyed_buffer_2000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.5, col = \"red\", lwd = 1.5) +\ntm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \ntm_scalebar(position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\ntm_layout(frame = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the total number of buildings within each ringed region, we will need to first get the centroids of each building, and then count the number of points that intersect with each zone.\nYou can do that by using the st_centroid() function:\n\nkonya_buildings_points &lt;- konya_buildings_3857 %&gt;% st_centroid()\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n\nNow, calculate the number of buildings for the following:\n\n# calculate the number of buildings within 2000m from the focal point\ndestroyed_buffer_2000m$total_buildings &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(destroyed_buffer_2000m, konya_buildings_points))\n# calculate the number of buildings within 2000-5000m from the focal point\nsevere_damaged_buffer_2000_5000m$total_buildings &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(severe_damaged_buffer_2000_5000m, konya_buildings_points))\n# calculate the number of buildings within 5000-9000m from the focal point\npartial_damaged_buffer_5000_9000m$total_buildings &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(partial_damaged_buffer_5000_9000m, konya_buildings_points))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen viewing inside these data frame - you should see the total number of buildings for each buffer. The total number of buildings in that regions is 28,765. We can calculatethe prevalence (or proportion) of buildings by disaster outcomes i.e., destroyed, severely damage, or partially damaged by the earthquake:\n\nPrevalence of buildings that sustain partial damage (5000-9000m from focal point) = 10734/28765 = 37.31%\nPrevalence of buildings that were severely damaged (2000-5000m from focal point) = 3180/28765 = 11.05%\nPrevalence of buildings that were completely destroyed (&lt;2000m from focal point) = 294/28765 = 1.02%\nPrevalence of buildings that survival (&gt;9000m from focal point) = 50.62%\n\n\n\nLet’s put all the information together:\n\n# add buildings\ntm_shape(konya_buildings_3857) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0) +\n# add the single focal point of the earthquake\ntm_shape(focal_earthquake_point_3857) + \n    tm_dots(size = 0.5, fill = \"red\", col = \"red\") +\n# add the thirdmost outer ring (5000-9000m) and make fill colour pink, and line as dashes in pink colour\ntm_shape(partial_damaged_buffer_5000_9000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"pink\", fill_alpha = 0.1, col = \"pink\", lwd = 1.1, lty=\"dashed\") +\n    # add the second middle ring (2000-5000m)\ntm_shape(severe_damaged_buffer_2000_5000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.2, col = \"red\", lwd = 1.1, lty=\"dashed\") +\n# add the 1st ring as solid red polygon with transparency of 0.4\ntm_shape(destroyed_buffer_2000m) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.5, col = \"red\", lwd = 1.5) +\ntm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \ntm_scalebar(position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\ntm_layout(frame = FALSE) +\ntm_credits(\"Prevalence [%]\\nPartial: 37.31%\\nSevere: 11.05%\\nDestroyed: 1.02%\\nSurvived: 50.62%\", position = c(\"left\", \"top\"), size = 0.8)",

    "text": "[Watch on YouTube]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Watch on YouTube]\nThis week, we focus on the first of two key properties of spatial data: spatial dependence. Spatial dependence is the idea that the observed value of a variable in one location is often dependent (to some degree) on the observed value of the same value in a nearby location. For spatial analysis, this dependence can be assessed and measured statistically by considering the level of spatial autocorrelation between values of a specific variable, observed in either different locations or between pairs of variables observed at the same location. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when these values are not independent of one another and instead cluster together across geographic space.\nA critical first step of spatial autocorrelation is to define the criteria under which a spatial unit (e.g. an areal or point unit) can be understood as a “neighbour” to another unit. As highlighted in previous weeks, spatial properties can often take on several meanings, and as a result, have an impact on the validity and accuracy of spatial analysis. This multiplicity also can be applied to the concept of spatial neighbours which can be defined through adjacency, contiguity or distance-based measures. As the specification of these criteria can impact the results, the definition followed therefore need to be grounded in particular theory that aims to represent the process and variable investigated.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the notion that spatial dependence refers to the degree of spatial autocorrelation between independently measured values observed in geographical space. We will learn how to estimate global measures of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Moran’s I) to provide a singular measure of spatial dependence. We will learn how Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) to perform a similar function but yield multiple location-specific measures of spatial dependence.\n\n\n\nTo enable the efficient, repeatable and reproducible functionality of our work, we will use R-Studio’s ability to create and host code as a script.

As part of this, we look at the multiple methods to defining spatial neighbours and their suitability of use across different spatial phenomena – and how this approach is used to generate spatial weights for use within these spatial autocorrelation methods as well as their potential to generate spatially-explicit variables.\nWe put these learnings into practice through an analysis of spatial dependence of areal crime data, experimenting with the deployment of different neighbours and the impact of their analyses. For this practical we will look at the distribution of thefts from persons in the borough of Camden.\n\n2.1 Neighbours\nIf we want to come up with quantifiable descriptions of variables and how they vary over space, then we need to find ways of quantifying the distance from point to point. When you attach values to the polygons of wards in London, and visualise them, different patterns appear, and the different shapes and sizes of the polygons effect what these patterns look like. There can appear to be clusters, or the distribution can be random. If you want to explain and discuss variables, the underlying causes, and the possible solutions to issues, it becomes useful to quantify how clustered, or at the opposite end, how random these distributions are. This issue is known as spatial autocorrelation.\nIn raster data, variables are measured at regular spatial intervals (or interpolated to be represented as such). Each measurement is regularly spaced from its neighbours, like the pixels on the screen you are reading this from. With vector data, the distance of measurement to measurement, and the size and shape of the “pixel” of measurement becomes part of the captured information. Whilst this can allow for more nuanced representations of spatial phenomena, it also means that the quantity and type of distance between measurements needs to be acknowledged.\nIf you want to calculate the relative spatial relation of distributions, knowledge of what counts as a “neighbour” becomes useful. Neighbours can be neighbours due to euclidean distance (distance in space), or they can be due to shared relationships, like a shared boundary, or they can simply be the nearest neighbour, if there aren’t many other vectors around. Depending on the variable you are measuring the appropriateness of neighbourhood calculation techniques can change.\n\n2.1.1 Loading our data sets\nNow we have the data in the correct folders, we can load and plot the shape data.\n\n# load Camden boundaries\ncamden_oas &lt;- st_read('OAs_camden_2011.shp', crs=27700)\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(camden_oas) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how one of these output areas could have many more neighbours than others, they vary a great deal in size and shape. The dimensions of these objects change over space, as a result the measurements within them must change too.\nOutput areas are designed to convey and contain census information, so they are created in a way that maintains a similar number of residents in each one. The more sparsely populated an OA the larger it is. Output Areas are designed to cover the entirety of the land of England and Wales so they stretch over places where there are no people. In the north of Camden the largest Ouput Areas span over Hampstead Heath, a large park.\nLet’s explore how to find different kinds of neighbours using the example of one ‘randomly’ selected output area (E00004174) that happens to contain the UCL main campus.\n\n# highlight E00004174\ntm_shape(camden_oas) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"white\", col= \"black\") +\n    tm_shape(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD=='E00004174',]) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Euclidean neighbours\nThe first way we are going to call something a neighbour is by using Euclidean distance. As our OA shapefile is projected in BNG (British National Grid), the coordinates are planar, going up 1 is the same distance as going sideways 1. Even better the coordinates are in metric measurements so it’s easy to make up heuristic distances.\nLet’s call every output area with a centroid 500m or less away from the centroid of our chosen OA a neighbour:\n\nwe select only the the centroid of our chosen output area and all other areas (with st_centroid())\nwe set the maximum number of neighbours we want to find to “50” (with parameter k)\nwe set the maximum distance of calling an OA centroid a neigbour to “500” (with parameter maxdist)\nwe return a sparse matrix that tells us whether each OA is a neighbour or not (with parameter sparse)\n\n\n# assign our chosen OA to a variable \nchosen_oa &lt;- 'E00004174'\n\n# identify neighbours\nchosen_oa_neighbours &lt;- st_nn(st_geometry(st_centroid(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD==chosen_oa,])), \n                              st_geometry(st_centroid(camden_oas)),\n                              sparse = TRUE,\n                              k = 50,\n                              maxdist = 500) \n\n# inspect\nclass(chosen_oa_neighbours)\n\n# get the names (codes) of these neighbours\nneighbour_names &lt;- camden_oas[chosen_oa_neighbours[[1]],]\nneighbour_names &lt;- neighbour_names$OA11CD\n\n# inspect\n# add base layer\ntm_shape(camden_oas) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n# add neighbours layer to highlight only the neighbours of E00004174\ntm_shape(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD %in% neighbour_names,]) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"green\", col = \"black\") +\n# add to show chosen OA E00004174\ntm_shape(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD==chosen_oa,]) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Shared boundary neighbours\nThe next way of calculating neighbours takes into account the actual shape and location of the polygons in our shapefile. This has only recently been added to the world of sf(), previously we would have reverted to using the sp() package and others that depend on it such as spdep().\nWe can create two functions that check whether any polygons share boundaries or overlap one another, and then also check by how much. These new functions are based on the st_relate() function. The different cases of these are known as queen, and rook. These describe the relations in a similar way to the possible chess board movements of these pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo have a look at the short lectures by Luc Anselin on Moran’s I, the interpretation of Moran’s I, and neighbours and spatial weights for some additional explanation on measuring spatial autocorrelation with Moran’s I.\nThese functions are created for the sole purpose of demonstrating what contiguity spatial weight matrices are:\n\n# for rook case\nst_rook &lt;- function(a, b = a) st_relate(a, b, pattern = 'F***1****')\n\n# for queen case\nst_queen &lt;- function(a, b = a) st_relate(a, b, pattern = 'F***T****')\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve created the functions lets try them out.\nQueen\n\n# identify neighbours based on Queen\nchosen_oa_neighbours_queen &lt;- st_queen(st_geometry(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD==chosen_oa,]), \n    st_geometry(camden_oas))\n\n# get the names (codes) of these neighbours\nneighbour_names_qn &lt;- camden_oas[chosen_oa_neighbours_queen[[1]],]\nneighbour_names_qn &lt;- neighbour_names_qn$OA11CD\n\n# inspect\n# add base layer\ntm_shape(camden_oas) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    # add neighbours layer to highlight only the neighbours of E00004174\n    tm_shape(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD %in% neighbour_names_qn,]) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"green\", col = \"black\") +\n    # add to show chosen OA E00004174\n    tm_shape(camden_oas[camden_oas$OA11CD==chosen_oa,]) + \n    tm_polygons(fill = \"red\", col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the tolerance of the shared boundaries in the st_rook() pattern and the st_queen() pattern, in this example they both assign the same neighbours. This is true for many non-square polygons as the difference is often given as whether two shapes share one or more points. Therefore the difference can have more to do with the resolution and alignment of your polygons than the actual spatial properties they represent. They can and do find different neighbours in other situations. Follow the grid example in the st_relate() documentation if you want to see it working.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Theft in Camden\nNow that we have found the different ways of finding neighbours we can consider how they relate to one another. There are two ways of looking at spatial autocorrelation:\n\nGlobal: This is a way of creating a metric of how regularly or irregularly clustered the variables are over the entire area studied.\nLocal: This is the difference between an area and its neighbours. You would expect neighbours to be similar, but you can find exceptional places and results by seeing if places are quantifiably more like or dislike their neighbours than the average other place.\n\nBut before we start that let’s get into the data we are going to use! We’ll be using personal theft data from around Camden. Our neighbourhood analysis of spatial autocorrelation should allow us to quantify the pattern of distribution of reported theft from persons in Camden in 2019.\n\n# load theft data\ncamden_theft &lt;- read.csv('2019_camden_theft_from_person.csv')\n\n# convert csv to sf object\ncamden_theft &lt;- st_as_sf(camden_theft, coords = c('X','Y'), crs = 27700)\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(camden_oas) +\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(camden_theft) +\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is point data, but we are interested in the polygons and how this data relates to the administrative boundaries it is within. Let’s count the number of thefts in each OA. This is a spatial operation that is often called “point in polygon”. As we are just counting the number of occurrences in each polygon it is quite easy. In the future you may often want to aggregate over points for an area, or in reverse assign values from the polygon to the points.\n\n# thefts in Camden\ncamden_oas$n_thefts &lt;- lengths(st_intersects(camden_oas, camden_theft))\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(camden_oas) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"n_thefts\", \n        fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(breaks=c(0,1,50,100,150,200,250,300,350)),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title =\"Reported Thefts\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see our map is skewed by central London, meaning that the results in central London (the south of Camden) are so much larger than those in the north that it makes it harder to see the smaller differences between other areas. We’ll take the square root of the number of thefts to remedy this.\n\n# square root of thefts\ncamden_oas$sqrt_n_thefts &lt;- sqrt(camden_oas$n_thefts)\n\n# inspect\ntm_shape(camden_oas) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"sqrt_n_thefts\", \n        fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(breaks=c(0,1,5,10,15,20)),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title =\"Reported Thefts (Squared)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere: a slightly more nuanced picture\n\n\n2.3 Global Moran’s I\nWith a Global Moran’s I we can test how “random” the spatial distribution of these values is. Global Moran’s I is a metric between -1 and 1. -1 is a completely even spatial distribution of values, 0 is a “random” distribution, and 1 is a “non-random” distribution of clearly defined clusters.\nTo calculate the Global Moran’s I you need an adjacency matrix that contains the information of whether or not an OA is next to another. For an even more nuanced view you can include distance, or a distance weighting in the matrix rather than just the TRUE or FALSE, to take into account the strength of the neighbourhoodness. Because of the way Moran’s I functions in R it is necessary to use the sp and spdep libraries (which we have loaded earlier). As you will see these methods and functions have quite esoteric and complicated syntax. Some of the operations they will do will be similar to the examples shown earlier, but the way they assign and store variables makes it much quicker to run complex spatial operations.\n\n# inspect\nclass(camden_oas)\n\n\n## [1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\n# convert to sp\ncamden_oas_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(camden_oas, IDs=camden_oas$OA11CD)\n\n# inspect\nclass(camden_oas_sp)\n\n\n## [1] \"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame\"\n## attr(,\"package\")\n## [1] \"sp\"\n\nNow we can make the esoteric and timesaving “nb” object in which we store for each OA which other OAs are considered to be neighbours.\n\n# create an nb object\ncamden_oas_nb &lt;- poly2nb(camden_oas_sp, row.names=camden_oas_sp$OA11CD)\n\n# inspect\nclass(camden_oas_nb)\n\n\n## [1] \"nb\"\n\n\n# inspect\nstr(camden_oas_nb,list.len=10)\n\n\n## List of 749\n##  $ : int [1:7] 10 15 215 303 327 375 464\n##  $ : int [1:5] 19 72 309 365 430\n##  $ : int [1:3] 133 152 709\n##  $ : int [1:7] 78 131 152 286 314 582 651\n##  $ : int [1:5] 67 316 486 492 703\n##  $ : int [1:8] 7 68 317 487 556 612 625 638\n##  $ : int [1:3] 6 68 317\n##  $ : int [1:7] 57 58 164 358 429 605 684\n##  $ : int [1:5] 58 164 489 609 700\n##  $ : int [1:7] 1 215 245 311 327 366 644\n##   [list output truncated]\n##  - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n##  - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:749] \"E00004395\" \"E00004314\" \"E00004578\" \"E00004579\" ...\n##  - attr(*, \"call\")= language poly2nb(pl = camden_oas_sp, row.names = camden_oas_sp$OA11CD)\n##  - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"queen\"\n##  - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi TRUE\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighbouring polygon. In our case, each neighbouring polygon will be assigned equal weight with style='W'. After this, we can calculate a value for the Global Moran’s I.\n\n# create the list weights object\nnb_weights_list &lt;- nb2listw(camden_oas_nb, style='W')\n\n# inspect\nclass(nb_weights_list)\n\n\n## [1] \"listw\" \"nb\"\n\n\n# Moran's I\nmi_value &lt;- moran(camden_oas_sp$n_thefts,nb_weights_list,n=length(nb_weights_list$neighbours),S0=Szero(nb_weights_list))\n\n# inspect\nmi_value\n\n\n## $I\n## [1] 0.4772137\n## \n## $K\n## [1] 75.21583\n\nThe Global Moran’s I seems to indicate that there is indeed some spatial autocorrelation in our data, however, this is just a quick way to check the score. To do so properly we need to compare our score a randomly distributed version of the variables. We can do this by using something called a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n# run a Monte Carlo simulation 599 times\nmc_model &lt;- moran.mc(camden_oas_sp$n_thefts, nb_weights_list, nsim=599)\n\n# inspect\nmc_model\n\n\n## Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n## \n## data:  camden_oas_sp$n_thefts \n## weights: nb_weights_list  \n## number of simulations + 1: 600 \n## \n## statistic = 0.47721, observed rank = 600, p-value = 0.001667\n## alternative hypothesis: greater\n\nThis model shows that our distribution of thefts differs significantly from a random distribution. As such, we can conclude that there is significant spatial autocorrelation in our theft data set.\n\n\n2.4 Local Moran’s I (or LISA)\nWith a measurement of local spatial autocorrelation we could find hotspots of theft that are surrounded by areas of much lower theft. According to the previous global statistic these are not randomly distributed pockets but would be outliers against the general trend of clusteredness! These could be areas that contain very specific locations, where interventions could be made that drastically reduce the rate of crime rather than other areas where there is a high level of ambient crime.\n\n# Local Moran's I\nlocal_moran_camden_oa_theft &lt;- localmoran(camden_oas_sp$n_thefts, nb_weights_list)\n\nRemember in the lecture the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo properly utilise these local statistics and make an intuitively useful map, we need to combine them with our crime count variable. Because of the way the new variable will be calculated, we first need to rescale our variable so that the mean is 0.\n\n# rescale\ncamden_oas_sp$scale_n_thefts &lt;- scale(camden_oas_sp$n_thefts)\n\nTo compare this rescaled value against its neighbours, we subsequently need to create a new column that carries information about the neighbours. This is called a spatial lag function. The “lag” just refers to the fact you are comparing one observation against another, this can also be used between timed observations. In this case, the “lag” we are looking at is between neighbours.\n\n# create a spatial lag variable \ncamden_oas_sp$lag_scale_n_thefts &lt;- lag.listw(nb_weights_list, camden_oas_sp$scale_n_thefts)\n\nNow we have used sp for all it is worth it’s time to head back to the safety of sf() before exploring any forms of more localised patterns.\n\n# convert to sf\ncamden_oas_moran_stats &lt;- st_as_sf(camden_oas_sp)\n\nTo make a human readable version of the map we will generate some labels for our findings from the Local Moran’s I stats. This process calculates what the value of each polygon is compared to its neighbours and works out if they are similar or dissimilar and in which way, then gives them a text label to describe the relationship.\n\n# MAP 1: VERSION WITH FULL CLUSTER HH, HL, LH, LL DETAILS\n# classification without significance value\ncamden_oas_moran_stats$quad_non_sig &lt;- ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                              camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &gt; 0, \n                                              'high-high', \n                                       ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                              camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0, \n                                              'low-low', \n                                       ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                              camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0, \n                                              'high-low', \n                                       ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                              camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &gt; 0,\n                                              'low-high',NA))))\n\n# MAP 2: VERSION WITH SIGNIFICANCE\n# set a significance value\nsig_level &lt;- 0.1\n# classification with significance value\ncamden_oas_moran_stats$quad_sig &lt;- ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                          camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                          local_moran_camden_oa_theft[,5] &lt;= sig_level, \n                                          'high-high', \n                                   ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                          camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                          local_moran_camden_oa_theft[,5] &lt;= sig_level, \n                                          'low-low', \n                                   ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                          camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                          local_moran_camden_oa_theft[,5] &lt;= sig_level, \n                                          'high-low', \n                                   ifelse(camden_oas_moran_stats$scale_n_thefts &lt;= 0 & \n                                          camden_oas_moran_stats$lag_scale_n_thefts &gt; 0 & \n                                          local_moran_camden_oa_theft[,5] &lt;= sig_level, \n                                          'low-high',\n                                   ifelse(local_moran_camden_oa_theft[,5] &gt; sig_level, \n                                          'not-significant', \n                                          'not-significant')))))\n\nTo understand how this is working we can look at the data non-spatially. As we rescaled the data, our axes should split the data neatly into their different area vs spatial lag relationship categories. Let’s make the scatterplot using the scaled number of thefts for the areas in the x axis and their spatially lagged results in the y axis.\n\n# plot 1\n# plot the results without the statistical significance\nggplot(camden_oas_moran_stats, aes(x = scale_n_thefts, \n                                   y = lag_scale_n_thefts, \n                                   color = quad_non_sig)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + # plot vertical line\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + # plot horizontal line\n  xlab('Scaled Thefts (n)') +\n  ylab('Lagged Scaled Thefts (n)') +\n  labs(colour='Relative to neighbours') +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# plot 2\n# plot the results with the statistical significance\nggplot(camden_oas_moran_stats, aes(x = scale_n_thefts, \n                                   y = lag_scale_n_thefts, \n                                   color = quad_sig)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + # plot vertical line\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + # plot horizontal line\n  xlab('Scaled Thefts (n)') +\n  ylab('Lagged Scaled Thefts (n)') +\n  labs(colour='Relative to neighbours') +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see how they are arranged spatially.\n\n# map all of the results here\ntm_shape(camden_oas_moran_stats) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"quad_non_sig\", fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(values = c(\"#de2d26\", \"#fee0d2\", \"#deebf7\", \"#3182bd\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# map only the statistically significant results here\ntm_shape(camden_oas_moran_stats) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = \"quad_sig\", fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(values = c(\"#de2d26\", \"#deebf7\", \"white\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs our data are so spatially clustered we can’t see any outlier places (once we have ignored the non-significant results). This suggests that the pattern of theft from persons is not highly concentrated in very small areas or particular Output Areas, and instead is spread on a larger scale than we have used here. To go further than we have today it would be possible to run the exact same code but using a larger scale, perhaps LSOA, or Ward, and compare how this changes the Moran’s I statistics globally and locally. Or, to gain statistical significance in looking at the difference between areas getting more data perhaps over a longer timescale, where there are less areas with 0 thefts.",

The session aims to introduce you to the basic programming etiquette, as well as building confidence for using RStudio as a GIS tool. At the end of this session, you should be able to perform some basic data managing tasks as well as generate a simple choropleth map in RStudio.\n\n\n\nThe first task includes getting you started with RStudio by installing the needed software(s) (i.e., RStudio and R) on to your personal laptop, and becoming familiar with its environment and panels. We will begin a soft introduction on the basics of managing data in RStudio. This includes learning how to create various objects in RStudio such as vector and data frame objects. The crucial part of this session we be to know how to the set working directories as well as import your dataset in RStudio. Finally, we will learn how to perform the basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio.\nLet us begin.\n\n\n\nYou should by now have opened RStudio on your laptop. When opening RStudio for the first time, you are greeted with its interface. The window is split into three panels: 1.) R Console, 2.) Environments and 3.) Files, help & Output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel 1: The Console lets the user type in R-codes to perform quick commands and basic calculations.\nPanel 2: The Environments lets the user see which datasets, spatial objects and other files are currently stored in RStudio’s memory\nPanel 3: Under the File tab, it lets the user access other folders stored in the computer to open datasets. Under the Help tab, it also allows the user to view the help menu for codes and commands. Finally, under the Plots tab, the user can perusal his/her generated plots (e.g., histogram, scatterplot, maps etc.).\n\nThe above section is the Menu Bar. You can access other functions for saving, editing, and opening a new Script File for writing codes. Opening a new Script File will reveal a fourth panel above the Console.\nYou can open a Script File by:\n\nClicking on the File tab listed inside the Menu Bar. A scroll down bar will reveal itself. Here, you can scroll to the section that says New File.\nUnder New File, click on R Script. This should open a new Script File titled “Untitled 1”.\n\n\nImportant Notes: Throughout the course, and in all practical tutorials, you will be encouraged to use an R Script for collating and saving the codes you have written for carrying out spatial analysis. However, we will start writing codes in a script later when we reach to section 1.3 of this tutorial. For now, let us start with the absolute basics, which is interacting with the R Console and using it as a basic calculator for typing simple code.\n\n\n\n\nThe R console window (i.e., Panel 1) is the place where RStudio is waiting for you to tell it what to do. It will show the code you have commanded RStudio to execute, and it will also show the results from that command. You can type the commands directly into the window for execution as well.\nLet us start by using the console window as a basic calculator for typing in addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponents (^) and performing other complex sums.\nClick inside the R Console window and type 19+8, and press enter key button ↵ to get your answer. Quickly perform the following maths by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# Perform addition\n19+8\n\n# Perform subtraction\n20-89\n\n# Perform multiplication\n18*20\n\n# Perform division\n27/3\n\n# To number to a power e.g., 2 raise to the power of 8\n2^8\n\n# Perform complex sums\n(5*(170-3.405)/91)+1002\n\nAside from basic arithmetic operations, we can use some basic mathematical functions such as the exponential and logarithms:\n\nexp() is the exponential function\nlog() is the logarithmic function\n\nDo not worry at all about these functions as you will use them later in the weeks to come for transforming variables. Perform the following by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# use exp() to apply an exponential to a value\nexp(5) \n\n# use log() to transforrm a value on to a logarithm scale\nlog(3)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with using the console as a calculator. Let us build from this and learn one of the most important codes in RStudio which is called the Assignment Operator.\nThis arrow symbol &lt;- is called the Assignment Operator. It is typed by pressing the less than symbol key &lt; followed by the hyphen symbol key -. It allows the user to assign values to an Object in R.\nObjects are defined as stored quantities in RStudio’s environment. These objects can be assigned anything from numeric values to character string values. For instance, say we want to create a numeric object called x and assign it with a value of 3. We do this by typing x &lt;- 3. When you enter the object x in the console and press enter ↵, it will return the numeric value 3.\nAnother example, suppose we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\". When you enter y in console, it will return the text value Hello.\nLet us create the objects a,b, c, and d and assign them with numeric values. Perform the following by typing them inside the R Console window:\n\n# Create an object called 'a' and assign the value 17 to it\na &lt;- 17\n# Type the object 'a' in console as a command to return value 17\na\n\n# Create an object called 'b' and assign the value 10 to it\nb &lt;- 10\n# Type the object 'b' in console as a command to return value 10\nb\n\n# Create an object called 'c' and assign the value 9 to it\nc &lt;- 9\n# Type the object 'c' in console as a command to return value 9\nc\n\n# Create an object called 'd' and assign the value 8 to it\nd &lt;- 8\n# Type the object 'd' in console as a command to return value 8\nd\n\nNotice how the objects a, b, c and d and its value are stored in RStudio’s environment panel. We can perform the following arithmetic operations with these object values:\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(a + b + c + d)/5\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(5*(a-c)/d)^2\n\nLet us create more objects but this time we will assign character string(s) to them. Please note that when typing a string of characters as data you will need to cover them with quotation marks \"...\". For example, say we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this by typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\".\nTry these examples of assigning the following character text to an object:\n\n# Create an object called 'e' and assign the character string \"RStudio\"\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\n# Type the object 'e' in the console as a command to return \"RStudio\"\ne\n\n# Create an object called 'f', assign character string \"Hello world\" \nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n# Type the object 'f' in the console as a command to return \"Hello world\"\nf\n\n# Create an object called 'g' and assign \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\ng &lt;- \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\n# Type the object 'g' in the console to return the result\ng\n\nWe are now familiar with using the console and assigning values (i.e., numeric and string values) to objects. The parts covered here are the initial steps and building blocks for coding and creating datasets in RStudio.\nLet us progress to section 1.3. Here is where the serious stuff start. We will learn the basics of managing data and some coding etiquette - this includes creating data frames, importing & exporting spreadsheets, setting up work directories, column manipulations and merging two data frames. Learning these basic tasks are key for managing data in RStudio.\n\nPoint of no return: From here on out - let us open a script file and type codes there instead of the Console. We are getting serious now, we will never use the Console again.",

    "text": "2 Basics of managing data in RStudio\n\n2.1 How do we enter data into RStudio?\nAs you have already seen, RStudio is an object-oriented software package and so entering data is slightly different for the usual way of inputting information into a spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Here, you will need to enter the information as a Vector object before combining them into a Data Frame object.\nConsider this crude example of data containing the additional health information for 4 people. It contains the variable (or column) names ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’\n\n\n\nid\nname\nheight\nweight\ngender\n\n\n\n\n1\nKofi\n1.65\n64.2\nM\n\n\n2\nHarry\n1.77\n80.3\nM\n\n\n3\nHuijun\n1.70\n58.7\nF\n\n\n4\nFatima\n1.68\n75.0\nF\n\n\n\nNow, when entering data to RStudio it is not like Microsoft Excel where we enter data into the cells of a spreadsheet. In RStudio, data is entered as a sequence of elements and listed inside an object called a vector. For instance, if we have three age values of 12, 57 and 26 years, and we want to enter this in RStudio, we need to use the combine function c() and combine these three elements into a vector object. Hence, the code will be c(12, 57, 26). We can assign this data by typing this code as age &lt;- c(12, 57, 26). Any time you type ‘age’ into RStudio console it will hence return these three values unless you chose to overwrite it with different information.\nLet us look at this more closely with the 'id' variable in the above data. Each person has an ID number from 1 to 4. We are going to list the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 as a sequence of elements into a vector using the combine function c() and then assign it to as a vector object calling it 'id'.\n\n# Create 'id' vector object \nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Type the vector object 'id' in console to see output\nid\n\nNow, let us enter the information the same way for the remaining columns for ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’ like we did for ‘id’:\n\n# Create 'name' vector object\nname &lt;- c(\"Kofi\", \"Harry\", \"Huijun\", \"Fatima\")\n\n# Create 'height' (in meters) vector object\nheight &lt;- c(1.65, 1.77, 1.70, 1.68)\n\n# Create 'weight' (in kg) vector object\nweight &lt;- c(64.2, 80.3, 58.7, 75.0)\n\n# Create 'gender' vector object\ngender &lt;- c(\"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\")\n\nNow, that we have the vector objects ready. Let us bring them together to create a proper dataset. This new object is called a Data frame. We need to list the vectors inside the data.frame() function.\n\n# Create a dataset (data frame)\ndataset &lt;- data.frame(id, name, height, weight, gender)\n\n# Type the data frame object 'dataset' in console to see output\ndataset\n\n# You can also see dataset in a data viewer, type View() to data:\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe column ‘id’ is a numeric variable with integers. The second column ‘name’ is a text variable with strings. The third & fourth columns ‘height’ and ‘weight’ are examples of numeric variables with real numbers with continuous measures. The variable ‘gender’ is a text variable with strings – however, this type of variable is classed as a categorical variable as individuals were categorised as either ‘M’ and ‘F’.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 How do we create a variable based on other existing variables in our data frame?\nTo access a variable by its name within a data frame, you will need to first type the name of the data frame followed by a $ (dollar sign), and then typing the variable’s name of interest. For instance, suppose you just want to see the height values in the Console viewer - you just type:\n\n# to access height - you need to type 'dataset$height'\ndataset$height\n\nWe can use other columns or variables within our data frame to create another variable. This technique is essentially important when cleaning and managing data. From this dataset, it is possible to derive the body mass index bmi from height and weight using the formula:\n\n\n\\(BMI = weight/height^2\\)\n\n\nTo generate bmi into our data frame, we would need to access the height (m) and weight (kg) columns using the $ from the data frame its stored to, and apply the above formula as a code to generate the new bmi column:\n\n# Create 'bmi' in the data frame i.e.,'dataset' and calculate 'bmi'\n# using the $weight and $height\ndataset$bmi &lt;- dataset$weight/((dataset$height)^2)\n# View the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the new bmi variable inside\nView(dataset)\n\nYou can overwrite the height (m) column to change its units into centimeters by multiplying it to 100; equally, the weight (kg) column can be overwritten and converted from units of kilograms to grams by multiplying it to 1000.\n\n# using $height and *100 \ndataset$height &lt;- dataset$height*100\n# using $weight and *100\ndataset$weight &lt;- dataset$weight*1000\n# use View() the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the updated variables\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n2.3 How do we set the working directory in our computer by connecting our folder to RStudio with the setwd() function?\nNow, we are getting very serious here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore we do anything - make sure to have downloaded the data set for week 1 if you haven’t done so by clicking here. In your computer, create a new folder on your desktop page and rename the folder to “GEOG0114”, and create another folder within “GEOG0114” and rename it as “Week 1”. Make sure to unzip and transfer ALL the downloaded data directly to the Week 1 folder.\n\n\nNow, this part of the practicals are probably the most important section of this tutorial. It’s usually the “make” or “break” phase (i.e., you ending up loving RStudio OR you hating it and not ever wanting to pick up R again).\nWe are going to learn how to set-up a working directory. This basically refers to us connecting the RStudio to the folder containing our dataset. It allows the user to tell RStudio to open data from a folder once it knows the path location. The path location specifies the whereabouts of the data file(s) stored within a computer. Setting your directory in RStudio beforehand makes life incredibly easier in terms of finding, importing, exporting and saving data in and out of RStudio.\nTo illustrate what a path location is – suppose on my desktop (mac/widows) there is a folder called “GEOG0114”, and within that folder, exists another folder called “Week 1”. Finally, suppose a comma separated value (.csv) data file called “London_LSOA_FireHazards.csv” is store in this last folder i.e., Week 1. If via RStudio you want to open this CSV data file located in within the “Week 1” folder. You will need to first set the path to “Week 1” in RStudio using the setwd() function.\nTherefore, the path location to this folder on a Windows machine would be written as follows, \"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by:\n\nOpen the GEOG0114 folder to reveal the Week 1 folder.\nOpen the Week 1 folder in the data files are stored.\nNow, click on the bar at the top which shows GEOG0114 &gt; Week 1. This should highlight and show \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\GEOG0114\\Week 1\" (see image below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, copy \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\GEOG0114\\Week 1\" and paste the path name into the setwd() function in your R script.\nLastly, change all the back slashes \\ in the path name to forward slashes / and run the code. It should look like this: setwd(\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1\").\n\nFor Windows, the setwd() is as follows:\n\n# set work directory in windows\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1\")\n\nFor MAC users, its marginally different. The path location would be written as follows, \"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by:\n\nRight-clicking on the folder “Week 1” (not file) in which the files are stored.\nHold the “Option” ⌥ key down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Copy \"filename\" as Pathname\nPaste the copied path name into the function setwd() and run the code\n\nFor Mac, the setwd() is as follows:\n\n# set work directory in macs\nsetwd(\"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1\")\n\nThis should set the working directory. Now, let us learn how to import a CSV data into RStudio.\n\n\n2.4 How do we import, merge and export CSV data with RStudio?\n\n2.4.1 Importing data using read.csv()\nAs you will be working mostly with comma separated value formatted data (i.e., csv) we will therefore learn how to import and export in RStudio. There are two files that we are going to import into RStudio from Week 1’s folder:\n\nLondon_LSOA_Deprivation_2019.csv which contains information on seven indicators (as scores) and an IMD ranking for socioeconomic deprivation for 4,836 postcodes across London in 2019.\nLondon_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv which contains details about the observed and estimated expected number of fire-related accidents to have occurred in residential premises with the overall number of houses in 4,836 postcodes across London in 2019.\n\nTo import a csv into RStudio, we use the read.csv() function. To demonstrate this, let us import the data for fires into an data frame object and name it as Fire_data\n\n# Import data using read.csv() function \nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nJust in case…suppose if we did NOT set the working directory earlier. We would have to go through the hassle of typing the path location in the read.csv().\nFor windows:\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nFor Mac:\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nI do not recommend doing it this way. Just set the work directory with setwd() to make life easier for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in read.csv() function – 1.) ‘file =’ is a mandatory option where you quote the name of the file to be imported; 2.) ‘header = TRUE’ option is set to TRUE which is telling RStudio that the file that is about to be imported has column names on the first row so it should not treat as observations; and 3.) ‘sep = \",\"’ we are telling RStudio that the format of the dataset is comma separated.\n\n\nWe have imported the fire hazards data. Now, let us import the second data for deprivation using the read.csv() function and call it Deprivation_data. The code would look something as follows:\n\n# Import data using read.csv() function \nDeprivation_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_Deprivation_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\n# Show viewer the data sets\nView(Deprivation_data)\nView(Fire_data)\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Joining two datasets by merger using the merge() function\nYou will often find yourself merging two or more data frames together, especially bringing together a spatial object with a non-spatial object. We cannot stress the importance of merging objects in the correct order so that the spatial attributes are preserved.\nIn this instance, we are just dealing with two ordinary dataset which are non-spatial - i.e., one data set contains information on Fires that occurred in geographic units in London know as Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA), while the other contains its corresponding information for socioeconomic indicators that describe the LSOA. Hence, it is possible to merge the two data frames uniquely using a common key variable like LSOA_code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis task can be done using the merge function merge(). Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_object, selected_object, by=”LSOA”).\nMerging data frames is indeed a very important technique to know especially if you need to bring together event information with no spatial dimension with actual spatial data. Alright, let’s merge the deprivation data on the fire records using the LSOA_code column, and generate a bigger data frame that contains both the fire and socioeconomic information:\n\n# Using the merge() function \nFull_data &lt;- merge(Fire_data, Deprivation_data, by.x = “LSOA_code”, by.y = “LSOA_code”, all.x = TRUE)\n\n# View the datasets\nView(Full_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in merge.csv():\n\nFire_data is the target data frame we want something to be merged on to.\nDeprivation_data is the selected data frame we are using to merge with the Fire_data.\nby.x = \"LSOA_code\" option we are specifying the name of the join column from the target data frame i.e., Fire_data.\nby.y = \"LSOA_code\" option we are specifying the name of the join column from the selected data frame i.e., Deprivation_data\nall.x=TRUE option we are telling RStudio to retain all rows that are originally from the target data after merging regardless of whether or not they are present in the selected data frame. So even if a row from the selected data does not find a unique link with any of the rows in target data to match too - it will still preserve the target data frame by not discarding unlinked rows. But it will discard the unmatched rows from the selected data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Saving your dataset using the write.csv() function\nLet us save a version of this as a .csv file as a saved product named “London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv”. This can be done by using the write.csv() function. It will export the data frame object into a .csv format.\n\n# Export ‘Full_data’ object as .csv into 'Week 1' folder\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe arguments used in merge.csv():\n\nFull_data is an object we are exporting. It is compulsory to specify the object data frame we want to export\nfile = is a mandatory argument. We must give a name to the file we wish to export it as with .csv extension.\nrow.names = this is an annoying argument! It will automatically index the dataset with unique row numbers by default if we do not specify FALSE! Since the data has its own unique identifiers (i.e., LSOA_code) we specify ‘FALSE’ to not perform this action of indexing\n\n\n\nAgain, suppose if you did NOT set the work directory to your folder, you will have to type the whole path location to where you want the data to be exported which could be a hassle:\nFor Windows:\n\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nFor Mac:\n\nwrite.csv(Full_data, file = \"/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 1/London_Fire_and_Deprivation_2019.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nAgain, I do not recommend doing it this way. Just set the work directory with setwd() to make life easier for yourself and to avoid R calling you out for errors.\nNow that we have learned a lot of the basic things in RStudio – the stuff shown in section 1.3 will be used quite a lot in future tutorials. Let us progress to the section 1.4 where will start using RStudio as a GIS software. Here, we will create our first map to display the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation using the Full_data data frame object.",

    "text": "3 Basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio\n\n3.1 Installing packages into RStudio\nSo far, we have been using functions and commands that are by default built-in RStudio. As you will become more and more proficient in RStudio, you will come to realise that there are several functions in RStudio that are in fact not built-in by default which will require external installation.\nFor instance, the sf package which is called Simply Features allows the user to load shapefiles (a type of Vector spatial data) into RStudio’s memory. Another important package is called tmap, this package gives access to various functions that allows the user to write code and emulate RStudio as a GIS software. These are examples of packages with enables mapping of spatial data. They need to be installed as they not built-in programs in RStudio.\nLet us install following packages: tmap and sf using the install.packages() function, and then activate the packages to make them active using the library() function.\nFirst install remotes, tmap and sf packages.:\n\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\ninstall.packages(\"tmap\")\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you MUST activate the packages using the library() function. Type the following to perform this action:\n\n# Active the sf and tmap packages\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"tmap\")\n\n\n\n3.2 Adding shapefiles in RStudio\nThe sf package grants the user access to a function called read_sf() to read-in shapefiles into RStudio. A shapefile typically contains the geometry of the spatial features e.g., points, line segment and boundaries of an areal feature etc. The shapefile has the extension of .shp (and it is always accompanied by its other supporting files with extensions .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFollowing files must all be stored in the same folder location with .shp file (i.e., .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg). If one is missing - the .shp file will not work!\n\n\nWe have two types of shapefiles:\n\nLondon_LSOA_Areas.shp which contains the spatial boundaries of all LSOA postcodes in London.\nLondon_Borough_Shapefile.shp which contains the spatial boundaries for all 33 Boroughs in London.\n\nWe can easily load them in RStudio as Spatial Polygon objects, type into your script:\n\n# Add shapefiles for LSOA and Boroughs\nlondon_lsoa_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_LSOA_areas.shp\")\nlondon_borough_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp\")\n\nWe interested in visualising the data at an LSOA-level. We would need to merge the non-spatial (aka ordinary) data i.e., Full_data, uniquely in to the Spatial Polygon object we loaded in previously i.e., london_lsoa_shapefile, using the LSOA_code column.\nAgain, we can use the merge() function to perform this task the same way we carried out the joining of the two ordinary data frames in section 1.3.4.2. Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_spatial_object, selected_non_spatial_object, by=\"LSOA\").\n\n# Using the merge() function \nSpatial_data &lt;- merge(london_lsoa_shapefile, Full_data, by.x = \"LSOA_code\", by.y = \"LSOA_code\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n# View the datasets\nView(Spatial_data)\n\n\n\n3.3 Mapping with ‘tmap’ functions in RStudio\nThe tmap is the best package for creating maps in RStudio – it’s easy to code and user friendly. Let’s finally start some mapping! Here are some basic ‘tmap’ functions to be very familiar with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap functions\nWhat it does…\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape()\nThis allows the user to add layers to be mapped\n\n\ntm_polygons()\nThis deal with vector type dataset specifically. This allows the user to specify which column in the vector layer to be mapped using the fill = argument. Within the tm_polygon(), it also allows the user to apply the appropriate customisation to the vector layer. Examples of such arguments in 1.) fill_alpha = to modify the transparency; 2.) col_alpha = to modify the transparency of the borders; 3.) col = controls the colour of the line; 4.) fill.scale = controls the appearence and set the colour scheme of the scale that appears inside the legends block. Please note that if your data is continuous, then the appropriate argument to use in the fill.scale = would be either tm_scale_continuous() or tm_scale_interval() for breaking the continuous values into intervals. If they are numerical but discrete (counts) use tm_scale_discrete(). Otherwise, if it is categorical use tm_scale_categorical(); and 4.) fill.legend = tm_legend(...) allows the user to control the presentation of the legend. There are many arguments to experiment with - you can type ?tm_polygons() in console to see them. Please note that the tm_polygons() is immediately followed after specifying the tm_shape() function.\n\n\ntm_layout()\nThis allows the user to make heavy customisations to the main title, legends and other cosmetics to text sizes etc.\n\n\ntm_compass()\nThis allows the user to add a compass visual to the map output\n\n\ntm_scale_bar()\nThis allows the user to add a scale bar to the map output\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Visualising the outline(s) of study area\nSuppose you want to visual just the outline of London’s LSOA only:\n\n# Visual outline of London’s LSOA postcodes only\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_polygons()\n\n# Insert the “Spatial_data” object into the command line of \n# tm_shape(). No customisation has been applied here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can customise the level of transparency for both the area and borders by adding some arguments in the tm_polygon() [i.e., fill_alpha, and col_alpha which only take values between 0 (full transparency) to 1 (100% solid)]. For example:\n\n# Controlling transparencies for borders and areas\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.1, col_alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Adding another layer on top of study area\nSuppose you want to add another layer to show the regions (i.e., Borough) of London for which the LSOA areas reside in, you can use another tm_shape() in the code, the coding would be as follows:\n\n# Adding another layer\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0.1, col_alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) +\n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col_alpha = 1, col = \"black\")\n\n# The background of the added layer (london_borough_shapefile) has been rendered \n# to full transparency with the fill_alpha set to 0 and it borders are fully solid \n# using col_alpha set to 1 and col (colour) set to “black” to appear pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Full visualising of data in the maps\nSuppose you want to visual the spatial data in those postcodes, we can use the tm_polygons() function. Let us visual the IMD_Decile column which has DISCRETE (or CATEGORICAL) values classed from 1 to 10 to signify areas that are deprived (with 1 being the poorest) and those that are wealthier (with 10 being the least deprived).\nThe coding would be as follows:\n\n# Generate map IMD_Deciles\n\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) +\n    tm_polygons(\n        fill = \"IMD_Decile\", \n        fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(values = \"brewer.rd_yl_gn\"),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Deprivation (Deciles)\", frame = FALSE, item.space = -0.2, position = tm_pos_out()),\n        fill_alpha = 1, \n        col_alpha = 0.5, \n        col = \"black\", \n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\nIn the tm_polygons(), we insert the variable of interest we want to visual at the fill = argument. The fill.scale = option allows us to select the appropriate fill scale colour scheme depending on the type of dataset we are using - here it is categorical, so we use tm_scale_categorical(). The fill_legend() allows us to apply the appropriate customisation to the legends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGeography 101 – when creating a map, it is always best to add the North compass and scale bar. This is done with the tm_compass() and tm_scalebar() functions. The tm_layout() allows you to make further customisations to the internal and external plot region of map such as turning of the plot frame or modifying the text size in output. You can experiment with them by checking the help menu – just type: ?tm_layout() in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes this computer lab session.

    "section": "6 Exercise",
    "text": "6 Exercise\nExploring the burden of fire hazards and vulnerability in London\nAn incidence rate (IR) is typically a measure of frequency used to quantify the occurrence of an event.\nThis basic quantitative measure is often applied in social sciences (e.g., criminology for crime rates, in education on pass rates for grades), epidemiology and disaster sciences as well. The study of fire hazards and safety is an intersection of these three fields.\nObjectives: Use the spatial data you have built throughout the exercise to visualise the distribution of incidence of fires that occurred in residential premises across postcodes in London in 2019.\nHINTS:\n\nThe incidence rate (I) formula for calculating fires hazards across LSOAs in London is the reported number of residential premises in an LSOA that experienced a fire event (E) divided by the total number of residential premises in an LOSA (T). This is shown below expressed per 1,000 residence (per capita). The reported number of residential premises is the column Fires2019. The total number of houses in an LSOA is the column TotalHouses2019 The incidence rate formula is:\n\n\n\n\\(I  = (E/T) × 1000\\)\n\n\n\nExperiment with the tmap functions and arguments to create a map showing the incidence rate of fire hazards across LSOAs in London. The output should look something as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tm_shape() functions to add the spatial data frame object with the incidence rates.\nIn the arguments for the tm_polygons() function, inside it, it should include the following codes: 1.) use the argument fill= to specify the name of the column to be mapped; 2.) use the argument fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous() to control how the scale in the legends should appear. It should be continuous as the incidence rates are continuous values. Therefore, within the tm_scale_continuous() argument, use the options values = to control the colour gradient from blue (i.e., low intensity of fire hazards) to red (i.e., high burden) by typing the colour scheme: “-brewer.rd_bu”; 3.) use the argument fill.legend = tm_legend() to control the appearence of the legend block. Inside the tm_legend() specific title = as “Fires per 1,000”, and remove the plot frame around the legend block by stating frame = FALSE; 4.) apply the further cosmetics changes using \"fill_alpha = 1\" (transparency of areas), col_alpha = 0.5 (transparency of lines), col = \"grey\" (color of the line) and lwd = 0.1 (line thickness).\nInclude the following customizations: 1.) a scale bar and a north arrow in the visualisation using the tm_scale_bar() and tm_compass(); and 2.) lastly, use the overlay of the London Borough shapefile add it on top of the London LSOA shapefile by using again, the tm_shape() function, and render it fully transparent. Try using the tm_text() function to include the names of the Boroughs in the visualisation - this column is called ctyua16nm in the Borough’s shapefile.\n\nQuestion: How would you provide a descriptive interpretation of the spatial distribution/incidence of residential fires across LSOAs in London?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHave a go at these questions before revealing the solution codes and output below\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see solution code:\n\nLoad the required packages:\n\nlibrary(\"tmap\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\n\nLoad in the required dataset i.e., London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv using the read.csv() function:\n\n# please be sure set the work directory according to your own PC\n# setwd(\"/Users/anwarmusah/Documents/Websites/GEOG0114/all_datasets/Week 1 - Dataset\")\n\nFire_data &lt;- read.csv(file=\"London_LSOA_FireHazards_2019.csv\", header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\nLoad in the required shapefile dataset i.e., London_LSOA_areas.shp and London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp using the read_sf() function:\n\n# Add shapefiles for LSOA and Boroughs\nlondon_lsoa_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_LSOA_areas.shp\")\nlondon_borough_shapefile &lt;- read_sf(\"London_Boroughs_Shapefile.shp\")\n\nMerge the fire records to LSOA shapefile using the merge() on common key column (e.g., LSOA_code):\n\nSpatial_data &lt;- merge(london_lsoa_shapefile, Fire_data, by.x = 'LSOA_code', by.y = 'LSOA_code', all.x = TRUE)\n\nCalculate the incidence of fires in London’s LSOA:\n\n# Calculate the incidence rate. \n# This requires creating a new variable in the `Spatial_data` data frame.\n# Let call the new variable 'IncidenceFires'. \n# We are creating the 'IncidenceFires' column based on 'Fires2019' and 'TotalHouses2019'\n# Its a rate per capita so we will divide the two and multiple it by 1000\n\nSpatial_data$IncidenceFires &lt;- (Spatial_data$Fires2019/Spatial_data$TotalHouses2019)*1000\n\nLet’s create the map that shows the burden of fires. Here, we will use a continuous scale for the colour gradient in the legend block:\n\n# Generate a incidence map 'with continuous scale' according to the criteria specified in the hints\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(\"IncidenceFires\",\n        fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = \"-brewer.rd_bu\", midpoint = 1.5),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Fires per 1,000\", frame = FALSE),\n        fill_alpha = 1,\n        col_alpha = 0.5,\n        col = \"white\",\n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_text(\"ctyua16nm\", size = \"AREA\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInterpretation: From this static map, it is difficult to discern the spatial patterns in incidence of fire hazards in residential dwellings in LSOAs in London. For instance, Boroughs such as Hackney appears to have a dispersed pattern with some LSOAs reporting high incidence rates. The borough of Bexley has high incidence rates concentrated in the North-East.\n\n\nYou can make this an interactive map by using the tmap_mode(\"view\") code. Let us print this output in an interactive map, so we can zoom into the details and have a clearer picture:\n\n# to map interactive using tmap_mode(\"view\") code, and re-run the map code again\n\n# active interactive mode\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n# re-run the map code again to show it in an interactive mode\ntm_shape(Spatial_data) + \n    tm_polygons(\"IncidenceFires\",\n        fill.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = \"-brewer.rd_bu\", midpoint = 1.5),\n        fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Fires per 1,000\", frame = FALSE),\n        fill_alpha = 1,\n        col_alpha = 0.5,\n        col = \"white\",\n        lwd = 0.1) +\n    tm_shape(london_borough_shapefile) + \n    tm_polygons(fill_alpha = 0, col = \"black\") +\n    tm_text(\"ctyua16nm\", size = \"AREA\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n    tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) + \n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n# switch off the interactive mode\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy running the code: tmap_mode(\"view\"), will cause all map outputs to be generated in interactivity mode. You can switch it off by running the following code: tmap_mode(\"plot\")",
