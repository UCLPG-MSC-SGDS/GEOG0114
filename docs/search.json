    "text": "Welcome to GEOG0114: Principles of Spatial Analysis, one of the core 1st term modules for this MSc programme (Social and Geographic Data Science). This module has been designed as an introduction to the core tenets and principles of spatial analysis. Here, you will learn the key concepts and spatial analytical methods, which are applicable to the domains of social science and geography.\nIn the first three weeks, we will cover Spatial analysis for data science, Graphical representation of spatial data and Spatial autocorrelation.\nAfterwards, in week 4, 5 and 6, we will cover a variety of basic geostatistical techniques that require analysis of point and raster data - these include suitability mapping such as Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ecological Niche Modelling; and then Geostatistical analysis using Kriging.\nIn week 7, 8, and 9, we will learn specialised tools for performing spatial analysis on vector data (e.g., point, line and areal structures) - these include the various spatial regression model families e.g., Spatial Lag & Error models, Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) and Spatial Risk Models. All these tutorials will be covered in RStudio.\n\n\nAll lectures and computer practicals will be delivered in-person. All Lectures are held on Monday from 01:00pm to 02:00pm at the North West Wing (Room G17). All computer lab seminars are delivered on Thursday from 03:00pm to 05:00pm at the North West Wing (Room G07).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Please bring your laptops with you to the computer practicals on Thursday\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodle is the central point of your learning experience for GEOG0114. Please use it on a regular basis to check for updates concerning the schedule for weekly topics, access to the practical materials and assessment. However, note that all lecture notes, videos, practical materials including reading lists and downloadable data sets will be hosted on this webpage.\nYou can download the lecture notes and data sets for the practical lesson from the table below.\n\n\n\nWeek\nDownloads\nTopics\n\n\n\n\n1\nSlides; Data\nSpatial analysis for data science\n\n\n2\nSlides; Data\nGraphical representation of spatial data\n\n\n3\nSlides; Data\nSpatial autocorrelation\n\n\n4\nSlides; Data\nSuitability mapping I\n\n\n5\nSlides; Data\nSuitability mapping II\n\n\n\n\nReading Week\n\n\n6\nSlides; Data\nGeostatistics using Kriging\n\n\n7\nSlides; Data\nSpatial models I (Lag & Error Regression)\n\n\n8\nSlides\nSpatial models II (Geographically Weighted Regression)\n\n\n9\nSlides\nSpatial models III (Bayesian Risk Models)\n\n\n10\nSlides\nRevision\n\n\n\nSolutions for Week: [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] | [5] | [6] | [7] | [8] | [9]\n\n\n\nFeel free to contact us via email for help, or book appointments for additional support if need be.
