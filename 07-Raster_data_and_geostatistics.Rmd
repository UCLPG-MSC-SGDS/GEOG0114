Today, we will learn how to perform **semivariogram** analysis which can be used to create continuous predictive maps based on spatial interpolation technique called **Kriging**. In this session, we will investigate spatial variation in outcomes that are, in theory, **spatially continuous**; for example, the concentrations of ambient air pollutants such as Sulphur dioxide ($SO_{2}$) (a toxic gas emitted from sulphur rich fuels (i.e., coal, oil or diesel) when burnt) which can be present anywhere but in practice are only measured at specified point locations, such as air quality monitoring stations.

We will assess for the presence of spatial autocorrelation using **semivariogram** which is distance-based, which describes the correlation of a variable with itself through geographic space. Here, a **Positive Autocorrelation** exists when measurements close to one another are alike than they would be due to chance or through random sampling. The presence of autocorrelation for spatially continuous phenomena can be established by using **semivariograms**.

Estimates from a semivariogram can be are used from model construction for spatial interpolation across a study area, whereby values at unsampled locations are predicted from neighbouring sites. A popular form of interpolation, which is based on the spatial attribute's outcome variable, is known as **Kriging** (a technique named after a South African engineer, Danie G. Krige (1919 to 2013)).

In you own time, see who Danie G. Krige is in this lecture [**[watch video]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cYZcmS48jI)

### Learning objectives 

The US Environmental Agency have positioned air quality monitors for surveillance of over 100 different types of pollutants that exist as toxic gases, particulates and heavy metals. For **Sulphur Dioxide** ($SO_{2}$), there are 458 active air monitors that takes hourly readings for concentrations of $SO_{2}$ (in parts per billion (pbb)). An annual estimate for $SO_{2}$ was calculated for each station at its location. Car usage, urbanisation and social economic deprivation, alongside of other anthropogenic activities such as coal burning, across the USA increases the risk of elevated pollution of $SO_{2}$.

Using geostatistical methods and taking into account of **car usage, urbanisation and levels of deprivation** - what areas in USA have higher concentrations of $SO_{2}$ exceeding the annual average of 40 ppb which is a national safety limit for cause of concern?

Let's use Kriging to find out!

### Datasets & setting up the work directory 

Before you begin do make sure to download all data by [**clicking here**](https://github.com/UCLPG-MSC-SGDS/GEOG0114/raw/main/Week%206%20-%20Dataset.zip). Create a folder on called "**Week 6**" within your "**GEOG0114**" folder stored in the desktop of your personal computer. Make sure to extract all data from the zip folder and store it into "**Week 6**" folder. Open a new R script and set the work directory to **Week 6's** folder.

For Windows, the work directory will be:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 6")
```

For MAC, the work directory will be:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Week 6")
```

### Loading and installing packages

We will need to load the following packages:

- `sf`: Simple Features
- `tmap`: Thematic Mapping
- `raster`: Raster/gridded data analysis and manipulation
- `sp`: Package for providing classes for spatial data (points, lines, polygons and grids)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load packages using library() function
library("sf")
library("tmap")
library("raster")
library("sp")
```

The above packages `sf`, `tmap`, `raster` & `sp`  should have been installed in the previous session(s). We will need to install the following package:

- `gstat`: provides functions for univariable and multivariable geostatistical analysis.
- `geoR`: provides additional functions for geostatistical and variogram analysis.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the packages: gstat using the install.package()
install.packages("gstat")
install.packages("geoR")

# Load the packages with library()
library("gstat")
library("geoR")
```

### Loading datasets

Let us first import the quantitative data i.e., `US 2019 SO2 Emissions data.csv` into R/RStudio.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Use read.csv() to import 
datafile <- read.csv(file = "US 2019 SO2 Emissions data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

**NOTE**: The description of the column names are as follows:

**Column Name** | **Description**
------------ | ------------------------------------------------
`CountyRef` | The County & State for where the air quality monitors are located in US
`Longitude` | Longitude (in decimal degrees)
`Latitude` | Latitude (in decimal degrees)
`Mean_SO2` | Annual Mean (ppb) concentrations of Ambient sulphur dioxide ($SO_{2}$) in 2019 
|
- Shape file: US National border named `US Nation Border.shp`
- Shape file: US State border named `US State Borders.shp`
- Raster: US Car Usage (5000m resolution) named `US Prevalence of Car Usage 5km.tif`
- Raster: US Urbanisation Index (5000m resolution) named `US Urbanisation Index 5km.tif`
- Raster: US Socioeconomic Deprivation (5000m resolution) named `US Socioeconomic Deprivation 5km.tif`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Use read_sf() function to load shape file 
US_Nation_Border_shp <- st_read("US Nation Border.shp")
US_State_Border_shp <- st_read("US State Borders.shp")
```

### Data preparation

There are a couple of things we need to do before proceeding with the analysis: 

1. The `datafile` is a data frame object in RStudio's memory, and not a spatial object. We need to coerce into a spatial `sf` object
2. The shapefiles for `US Nation Border.shp` & `US State Borders.shp` are in a different CRS called **Spherical Mercator 3857**
which measures distance in meters and not in decimal degrees. We need to transform the `longitude` and `latitude` of our stations
which are in decimal degrees to the CRS of **Spherical Mercator 3857**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Coerce the spreadsheet into a sf object
# First tell R that it’s coordinates are currently in decimal degrees (i.e., WGS84 'crs = 4326') before the transformation
datafile_sf <- st_as_sf(datafile, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
# Now apply the transformation from WGS84 to Mercator i.e., = 3857
datafile_sf_prj <- st_transform(datafile_sf, 3857)
# Inspect the details
st_crs(datafile_sf_prj)
```

The code chunk below generates an empty map with the `tmap` functions. It shows just the border of USA and the point locations for the air quality monitoring stations superimposed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(US_Nation_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") + 
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image1_1.png', error = FALSE) 
```

## Semivariogram analysis
Semivariograms describe how data are related with distance by plotting the **semivariance** against the **separation distance**, known as the **experimental** or **empirical semivariogram**. The semivariance is defined as half the average squared difference between points separated by some distance _h_. As the separation distance _h_ between samples increase, we would expect the semivariance to also increase (again, because near samples are more similar than distant samples).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_1.png', error = FALSE) 
```

In the generic semivariogram shown above, there are three important parameters: 

1. **Sill**: The maximum semivariance value observed, and it indicates the threshold for values beyond (i.e., flatline) which
there is no spatial autocorrelation. **NOTE**: the **Partial Sill** is a value calculated by taking the difference between 
the **Sill** and **Nugget** (i.e., **Partial Sill = Sill - Nugget**)
2. **Range**: The maximum separation distance _h_ at which we will expect to find evidence of spatial autocorrelation. A 
separation distance beyond the **range** samples are no longer correlated. 
3. **Nugget**: This describes the variance of the measurement error combined with spatially uncorrelated variations at distances
shorter than the sample spacing, namely noise in the data. The larger the **nugget** relative to the **sill**, the less spatial 
dependence there is in the data and less useful Kriging will be.

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: Two important assumptions of a basic semivariogram are that the spatial process under investigation are: i.)
**stationary**, i.e., the spatial autocorrelation between the measurements of same variables in a given area is the same for all
locations; and ii.) **isotropic**, spatial autocorrelation is the same in every direction. If the autocorrelation differs by direction, it is termed as **anisotropic**.
</div>

To be used in Kriging, a semivariogram plot (akin to the above image) must be generated to estimate the 3 parameters (i.e., sill, nugget & range) from the points termed **experimental** or **empirical semivariogram**. These are used as initial values to fit a **modelled** or **theoretical semivariogram** which can be in one of three major forms:

1. Gaussian Model (Left)
2. Spherical Model (Center)
3. Exponential Model (Right)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_1_5.png', error = FALSE) 
```

Once the modelled semivariogram has been defined, it can be used in Kriging. 

### Plotting the Empirical Semivariogram

Use the function `variogram()` to create the object for plotting the empirical variogram

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# coerce datafile_sf_prj to be a 'sp' spatial dataframe object as it's 
# ---variogram does not use 'sf' objects

# ignore warning message

datafile_sp_prj <- as(datafile_sf_prj, "Spatial")
# use variogram() function to compute the semivariance with a null model Mean_SO2 as outcome
SO2_emp.variogram <- variogram(Mean_SO2~1, datafile_sp_prj)
# Compute the object to reveal a table
SO2_emp.variogram
```

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: `np` in the output is the number of paired considered within the separation distance `dist`; `gamma` is the averaged semivariance for the number of paired points within the separation distance `dist`.
</div>

Let us plot these values to see the empirical semivariogram
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
plot(SO2_emp.variogram)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_2.png', error = FALSE) 
```

From the output (i.e., plot and table), we should note the approximate values for the `partial sill`, `nugget` and `range`.

1. The `nugget` is roughly **17** (i.e. base on starting `gamma` value from the table).
2. The `range` is roughly **1180000** meters (i.e. base on peak value for `gamma` and it's corresponding `dist`).
3. The `partial sill` is **65**. This is derived from the peak value for `gamma` subtracted by the `nugget` (`82 - 17 = 65`).

These initial values give us an idea of what to expect when we proceed to fit a **theoretical** semivariogram using the `fit.variogram()`. It will help us to generate the fitted models.

### Plotting the Theoretical Semivariogram

We are going to fit a model to the empirical semivariogram in order to determine the appropriate function for Kriging (i.e., spherical (`Sph`), exponential (`Exp`) or gaussian (`Gau`)). 

We will start fitting the various models:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit exponential
exp_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Exp", 1180000, 17))
exp_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, exp_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Exponential model (Nug: 3.6, PSill: 55.9, Range: 296255m)")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_3.png', error = FALSE) 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit Spherical
sph_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Sph", 1180000, 17))
sph_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, sph_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Spherical model (Nug: 10.5, PSill: 49.6, Range: 857452m)")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_4.png', error = FALSE) 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit gaussian
gau_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Gau", 1180000, 17))
gau_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, gau_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Gaussian model (Nug: 12.8, PSill: 39.1, Range: 244807m)")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_5.png', error = FALSE) 
```

By eyeballing the images - it difficult to discern whether the exponential or spherical model provides a better fit to the empirical semivariogram. We can use the `fit.variogram()` function to determine which is the best model amongst them. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# select the best model
best_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(c("Exp", "Gau", "Sph")))
best_SO2_emp.variogram
```

From the output (see column which says `model` and `row 2` it highlights `"Exp"`), it shows that the exponential model is the best fit with a `nugget = 3.6`, `Partial Sill =  55.9` and `Range = 296255m`. We therefore select the exponential model in our Kriging to make the spatial prediction for $SO_{2}$. Lets proceed to Krige. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image2_3.png', error = FALSE) 
```

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: The interpretation is as follows: the `nugget` in the exponential model is smaller than the other proposed models. It is small which is also an indication of evidence of larger spatial dependence in the concentrations for $SO_{2}$ across sampling sites in USA; A separation distance with values beyond `296255m` (where it curve starts to plateau) and beyond the semivariance's threshold where it flat lines (sill of `59.5` (i.e., `55.9 + 3.6`)) - there should expect that the spatial autocorrelation in the observed levels of $SO_{2}$ are not present anymore.
</div>

## Kriging modelling (null)

### Building a blank raster template

Let us create a template raster for interpolation. The extent of the raster template should based on the points. We are going to make the resolution of grid be at 5000m by 5000m (5km by 5km) accordingly.

```{r eval=FALSE}
RasterTemplate <- raster(datafile_sp_prj)
res(RasterTemplate) <- 5000
```

Next, declare template as a spatial grid

```{r, eval=FALSE}
grid.interpolation <- as(RasterTemplate, 'SpatialGrid')
```

### Implementing the spatial interpolation on blank template using Kriging

Now, we are going to use the parameters from the exponential theoretical semivariogram model to interpolate the concentrations of ambient SO2 for the entire study region

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelKrigingExp <- gstat(formula = Mean_SO2~1, locations = datafile_sp_prj, model = exp_SO2_emp.variogram)
```

The results are stored in `modelKrigingExp` object. Lets add the results of the interpolation to our grid template using the `predict()` function

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this may take roughly 5mins
Kriged_SO2 <- predict(modelKrigingExp, grid.interpolation)
```

The above analysis produces two separate rasters: i.) Predicted $SO_{2}$ and ii.) Variation in $SO_{2}$. Let export the results and make some visualisation using the `tmap` functions

### How to export the results as .tiff format thematic visualisation in `tmap`

Now, save both the prediction and variance a multi-layer raster (a 'brick' raster):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
brickedKriged_SO2_Results <- brick(Kriged_SO2)
```

We can save them individually from the multi-layer raster as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Separate the rasters accordingly
exp.prediction <- raster(brickedKriged_SO2_Results, layer = 1)
exp.variance <- raster(brickedKriged_SO2_Results, layer = 2)
#  save the output locally on your computer
writeRaster(exp.prediction, "Predicted SO2 levels in USA.tif", format="GTiff", overwrite = TRUE)
writeRaster(exp.variance, "Variance SO2 levels in USA.tif", format="GTiff", overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Thematic visualisation of raster data using `tmap`

We will need to perform a couple of steps before visualisation. First, we will need to mask the values of the raster predictions were made outside of US Border's region. To do this, we use the `mask()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# mask values of raster outside regions of US Border
US_Nation_Border_sp_shp <- as(US_Nation_Border_shp, "Spatial")
exp.prediction_masked <- mask(exp.prediction, US_Nation_Border_shp)
```

Next, we are going to make the raster image sit perfectly sit within the plot's frame using the country's bounding box or extent. We can extract the bounding box by using `st_bbox()` function on the `US_Nation_Border_shp` shape file object, this basically gives us the extent of the region.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
frameExtent <- st_bbox(US_Nation_Border_shp)
frameExtent
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
> frameExtent
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
-13885235   2819925  -7452828   6340334
```

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: The above values are essentially the coordinates that form a rectangle, a rectangular area which the USA country is bounded within. We are using this as the full plot region for the raster to prevent parts of the image not showing.
</div>

Now, let us visualise the predictions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(exp.prediction_masked, bbox = frameExtent) + tm_raster(title = "Predicted SO2 ppb", style = "cont", palette = "Reds") +
	tm_shape(US_State_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") +
	tm_text("STUSPS", size = "AREA") +
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) +
	tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.title.size = 0.5, legend.text.size = 0.5, legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image3_1.png', error = FALSE) 
```

The above shows the predicted concentrations of ambient $SO_{2}$; however, the predicted surface is very smooth and it difficult to see the spatial patterns. One technique, which is sometimes useful, for raster data is to reclassify the pixels to ordered categories i.e., zones instead of pixel-point estimates.

We could reclassify the continuous values stored in the grids/pixels into discrete values using the following scheme:

- 0 = `"< 1.0 ppb"`
- 1 = `"1.0-4.9 ppb"`
- 2 = `"5.0-9.9 ppb"`
- 3 = `"10.0-14.9 ppb"`
- 4 = `"15.0-19.9 ppb"`
- 5 = `"20.0-29.9 ppb"`
- 6 = `"30.0-39.9 ppb"`
- 7 = `"+40.0 ppb"`

You can do this by using the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a vector for the reclassification -i.e., 1st row captures values 
# --- between 0 and below 1 to reclassify a pixel as 0
# While the 2nd row in this vector captures values between 1 and below 5 to 
# --- reclassify a pixel as 1 and so on and so forth
reclassifyRaster <- c(0,1,0,
1,5,1,
5,10,2,
10,15,3,
15,20,4,
20,30,5,
30,40,6,
40,70,7)

# Then store the values into a matrix 
reclassifyRaster_Mat <- matrix(reclassifyRaster, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
reclassifyRaster_Mat
```

Now, apply the matrix to the raster object to reclassify the pixels accordingly using the `reclassify()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
exp.prediction_masked_rec <- reclassify(exp.prediction_masked, reclassifyRaster_Mat)
```

Now, lets visualise the predictionszones:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(exp.prediction_masked_rec, bbox = frameExtent) + tm_raster(title = "Predicted SO2 ppb", style = "cat", palette = "Reds", labels = c("<1.0 ppbs","1.0-4.9 ppb","5.0-9.9 ppb", "10.0-14.9 ppb" , "15.0-19.9 ppb", "20.0-29.9 ppb", "30.0-39.9 ppb","+40.0ppb")) +
	tm_shape(US_State_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") +
	tm_text("STUSPS", size = "AREA") +
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) +
	tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.title.size = 0.5, legend.text.size = 0.5, legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image3_2_5.png', error = FALSE) 
```

You can visualise the variance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# mask values of raster outside regions of US Border
exp.variance_masked <- mask(exp.variance, US_Nation_Border_sp_shp)

tm_shape(exp.variance_masked, bbox = frameExtent) + tm_raster(title = "Variance SO2 ppb", style = "cont", palette = "Oranges") +
	tm_shape(US_State_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") +
	tm_text("STUSPS", size = "AREA") +
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) +
	tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.title.size = 0.5, legend.text.size = 0.5, legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image3_2.png', error = FALSE) 
```

Again, it will be better to reclassify the raster for the variance to see where the model predicts the SO$_2$ with lower and high errors. We can use the `reclassify()` accordingly. Note that the lowest and highest estimated variance is `4.435438` and `57.59579`, respectively. Let us reclassify the variance raster using the following scheme:

- 0 = `"< 5.0 ppb"`
- 1 = `"5.0-9.9 ppb"`
- 2 = `"10.0-19.9 ppb"`
- 3 = `"20.0-29.9 ppb"`
- 4 = `"30.0-39.9 ppb"`
- 5 = `"40.0-49.9 ppb"`
- 6 = `"+50.0 ppb"`

Here is the code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
reclassifyRaster_var <- c(0,5,0,
	5,10,1,
	10,20,2,
	20,30,3,
	30,40,4,
	40,50,5,
	50,60,6)

reclassifyRaster_Mat_var <- matrix(reclassifyRaster_var, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
reclassifyRaster_Mat_var

exp.variance_masked_rec <- reclassify(exp.variance_masked, reclassifyRaster_Mat_var)

tm_shape(exp.variance_masked_rec, bbox = frameExtent) + tm_raster(title = "Variance SO2 ppb", style = "cat", palette = "Oranges", labels = c("<5.0 ppbs","5.0-9.9 ppb","10.0-19.9 ppb", "20.0-29.9 ppb" , "30.0-39.9 ppb", "40.0-49.9 ppb","+50.0ppb")) +
	tm_shape(US_State_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") +
	tm_text("STUSPS", size = "AREA") +
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) +
	tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.title.size = 0.5, legend.text.size = 0.5, legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week6/image3_4.png', error = FALSE) 
```

<div class="note">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: The above example was a null model. We can include risk factors as adjustments for the prediction. The below code shows you how to incorporate other variables in the analysis. We will use the other raster data sets for urbanisation, deprivation and car usage as adjustments in the Kriging model.

## Kriging modelling (non-null)

The code is a repeat of the above but with regression covariate adjustment.

# ignore that stupid warning message as its related to outdated 'rgdal & rgeos'. All raster are in the CRS Mercator 3857

# Step 2: Stack the three rasters together by using the stack() function 
predictors <- stack(US_urbanisation, US_SVI, US_CarUsage)

# Step 3: from the stacked data extract the raster values on the points of pollution stations using the extract() function

# those pollution stations and assuming those are the levels of urbanisation, deprivation and car usage at those points for
# which the SO2 levels are observed. 
View(datafile_sp_prj@data)

# Step 5: Linear Regression model to determine which variables are worth to be included in the Kriging model. If the turn out

# all variables are statistically significant. According to this model urbanisation and car usage marginally decreases SO2 levels,
# while areas of higher deprivation yields higher levels of SO2. Include all variables to the Kriging model since they are
# significant.

# Step 6: use variogram() function to compute the semivariance with variable in the model

# HERE ARE THE CORRECTIONS

## Practical homework

**Case study: Village survey of hookworm infection in Uganda and Tanzania**

We will use data on the prevalence of hookworm collected from 393 villages in Uganda and Tanzania. The dataset includes coordinates for each village, which have been geo-referenced to a specific longitude and latitude, as well as the boundaries of the study area for the two countries:

- Point data: `Soil_Transmitted_Helminth_Data.csv`
- Shapefile of region: `Study_Area_UG_TZ.shp`
- Shapefile of region with districts: `Study_Area_UG_TZ_Districts.shp`

These data can be downloaded [**[HERE]**](https://github.com/UCLPG-MSC-SGDS/GEOG0114/raw/main/Week%206%20-%20Homework%20Dataset.zip)

As shown in the practical, this analysis involves going through five stages: 

1. Data preparation and checking the distribution of points within the study area
2. Variogram analysis for generating an empirical variogram
3. Variogram analysis for generating a theoretical variogram to determine the appropriate model
4. Geostatistical prediction (Ordinary Kriging [null model])
5. Thematic mapping and visualisation.

Use Kriging to generate a predicted prevalence map of Hookworm infection for the entire study area in Uganda and Tanzania. The World Health Organisation has a classification for grading disease burden of this type of illness in the Global South:

- Areas with prevalence of < 1% are deemed as "Negligible" 
- Areas with a prevalence from 1% to 10% are deemed "Low risk"
- Areas with a prevalence from 10% to 20% are deemed "Moderate risk"
- Areas with a prevalence from 20% to 50% are deemed "High risk"
- Areas with a prevalence from 50% and more are zones where risks are "Excessive"

Produce an output that reflect the WHO's classification for this disease.
